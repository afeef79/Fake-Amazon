                    <h2>Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information? </h2>
                    <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the
                        business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share customers’ personal
                        information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and subsidiaries that Amazon.com,
                        Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as
                        protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transactions involving Third Parties:</strong>We make available to you services,
                            products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon
                            Services. For example, the products you order through our marketplace are from third
                            parties, you can download applications from third-party application providers from our App
                            Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or
                            sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as sellers on the marketplace,
                            restaurants registered on Amazon.in, merchants providing mobile recharges and bill-payment
                            assistance. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share
                            customers’ personal information related to those transactions with that third party</li>
                        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong>We employ other companies and individuals to
                            perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or
                            services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive
                            information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing
                            search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments,
                            transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer
                            service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to
                            perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process
                            the personal information in accordance with applicable law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or
                            buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is
                            one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
                            pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in
                            the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or Amazon Seller Services Private Limited or any of
                            its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information will
                            of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protection of Amazon and Others:</strong>We release account and other personal
                            information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply
                            our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
                            Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
                            organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be
                        shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the
                        information.</p>

                    <h2> What About Advertising?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong> Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:</strong> Amazon Services may
                            include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party
                            advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content,
                            advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon,
                            including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads policy. To adjust your
                            advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences page</li>
                        <li><strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong>We provide ad companies with
                            information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to
                            measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly
                            identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a
                            device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other
                            information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our
                            apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will
                            not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information
                            to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of
                            interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>What Information Can I Access?</h2>
                    <p> You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile
                        information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your Account"
                        section of the website or mobile application. Click here for a list of examples that you can
                        access. To request access to personal information that is not available through Your Account you
                        can submit a request here.</p>
                    <h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact
                        our Grievance Officer. Many of our Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with
                        options as to how your information is being used</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> As described above, you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you
                            might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in What
                            Information Can I Access?. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior
                            version for our records</li>
                        <li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, please adjust your
                            Customer Communication Preferences. If you don’t want to receive in-app notifications from
                            us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device</li>
                        <li>If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or
                            device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you
                            when you receive a new cookie or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and
                            identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we
                            recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our
                            cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or
                            use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other
                            identifiers, see our Cookies Notice.</li>
                        <li>If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you
                            may do so by logging out of your account here and blocking cookies on your browser.</li>
                        <li>You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your
                            settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and Devices"),
                            device, or application. For more information click here. Most non-Amazon devices also
                            provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location
                            services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings
                            menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices
                            manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your
                            device manufacturer.</li>

                    <h2> Are Children Allowed to Use Amazon Services ?</h2>
                    <p> Amazon does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase
                        by adults. If you are under the age of 18 years, you may use Amazon Services only with the
                        involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>

                        application of the prevailing law in India. If you have any concern about privacy at Amazon,
                        please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business

                        change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected
